# agent-phone

Access terminal sessions from your phone's browser. Works with Claude Code, or any CLI tool.

## How it works

1. Alias your command to run inside tmux (e.g., `alias claude='agent-tmux claude'`)
2. Run `agent-phone` on your server - it lists all tmux sessions on a web page
3. Open the picker from your phone and tap a session to connect via ttyd
4. Full terminal in your phone browser - same session as your computer

## Requirements

- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)
- [ttyd](https://github.com/tsl0922/ttyd)
- [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) (for secure access from phone)
- Go (to build)

## Install

```bash
# Install dependencies
# macOS
brew install tmux ttyd tailscale

# NixOS
nix-shell -p tmux ttyd tailscale

# Ubuntu/Debian
apt install tmux
# ttyd: see https://github.com/tsl0922/ttyd#installation

# Build the picker
go build -o agent-phone .

# Copy agent-tmux to your PATH
cp agent-tmux ~/.local/bin/
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/agent-tmux
```

Make sure `~/.local/bin` is in your PATH. Add to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

## Setup

### 1. Configure aliases

Add to your shell config (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):

```bash
alias claude='agent-tmux claude'
alias aider='agent-tmux aider'
# any other CLI tools you want phone access to
```

Now every `claude` command runs in a tmux session with a name like `claude-myproject-swift-oak`.

### 2. Start the picker

Run on your server/computer (the machine where you run your CLI tools):

```bash
./agent-phone
```

It binds to port 8090 on your Tailscale IP. You'll see output like:

```
Agent Phone picker running on http://100.x.x.x:8090
```

### 3. Connect from phone

1. Make sure your phone is on Tailscale
2. Open `http://<tailscale-ip>:8090` in your phone browser
3. You'll see a list of tmux sessions
4. Tap a session to connect

### Running as a service (optional)

To keep agent-phone running after logout, create a systemd service:

```bash
# ~/.config/systemd/user/agent-phone.service
[Unit]
Description=Agent Phone - tmux session picker
After=network.target tailscaled.service

[Service]
ExecStart=/path/to/agent-phone
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

Then:

```bash
systemctl --user enable agent-phone
systemctl --user start agent-phone
```

## How agent-tmux works

When you run `agent-tmux claude`:

1. Generates a unique session name: `claude-<project>-<adjective>-<noun>`
2. Creates a new tmux session running your command
3. Attaches you to that session

If you're already inside tmux, it creates a detached session and switches to it.

## Security

**Assumptions:**

- **Single-user Tailnet** - Anyone on your Tailnet gets full terminal access. There's no authentication beyond "can reach the Tailscale IP". Don't use this if you share your Tailnet with others.
- **Tailscale is running** - The server refuses to start without it (fail-closed). Tailscale provides encryption (WireGuard) and network-level access control.
- **Local machine is trusted** - Anyone who can create tmux sessions locally can make them accessible via phone.

**What's protected:**

- No binding to public interfaces (refuses to start if Tailscale unavailable)
- No open redirects (redirects use hardcoded Tailscale IP)
- No command injection (session names validated against actual tmux sessions)
- Orphaned ttyd processes cleaned up automatically

**What's NOT protected:**

- No auth within Tailnet (Tailnet access = full terminal access)
- No HTTPS (relies on Tailscale's WireGuard encryption)
- No audit logging
- No per-session permissions (all sessions visible to all)

## Troubleshooting

**"open terminal failed: not a terminal"**

This happens when tmux can't allocate a TTY. Make sure you're running from an interactive terminal, not a script or SSH without `-t`.

**macOS firewall blocking ttyd**

Add ttyd to allowed apps: System Settings -> Network -> Firewall -> Options -> Add `/opt/homebrew/bin/ttyd`.

**Sessions not showing**

- Make sure tmux sessions exist: `tmux list-sessions`
- Check that you're using the alias so commands run through `agent-tmux`

**ttyd not connecting**

- Check ttyd is running: `ps aux | grep ttyd`
- Verify it's bound to the right IP: should be your Tailscale IP, not localhost
- Clear stale tmux sockets if needed: `rm -rf /tmp/tmux-*` then retry

**"server exited unexpectedly" from tmux**

Clear stale tmux sockets:

```bash
rm -rf /tmp/tmux-*
```
